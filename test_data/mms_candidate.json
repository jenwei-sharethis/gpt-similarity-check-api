But the change to Green's shoes, from go-go boots to sneakers, caused outrage on social media, with many bemoaning the loss of the character's signature look. \\n A petition to \\\"keep the green M&M sexy\\\" garnered over 20,000 signatures.

Purple was recently deployed as part of a limited-edition pack of purple, brown and green M&M'S \\u2014 the colors of the female spokescandies \\u2014 in honor of International Women's Day. \\n That move prompted another round of criticism. \\n \\\"If this is what you need for validation, an M&M that is the color that you think is associated with feminism, then I'm worried about you,\\\" Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum said, adding that the move emboldened China. \\\"I think that makes China say, 'Oh, good, keep focusing on that.

(AP Photo\\/Chris Pizzello, File) \\u00a0Read Less \\n NEW YORK (AP) \\u2014 Mars says it\\u2019s pausing using its trademark M&M\\u2019s spokescandies and has enlisted actor and comedian Maya Rudolph to star in its marketing efforts, including its Super Bowl ad campaign. \\n The news comes three weeks before M&Ms is set to return to the Super Bowl with an ad after sitting it out last year. Mars hasn\\u2019t disclosed any other creative details about the ad. \\n The Super Bowl is advertising\\u2019s biggest stage, with big-name brands pulling out all the stops and paying millions for a 30-second ad in an effort to capture the attention of the more than 100 million viewers that watch the game live. Many spend millions more on marketing campaigns leading up to the big event. \\n Mars revamped the M&M candies last year. which are featured in red, green, orange, yellow, brown and blue, to give them more nuanced personalities. The green M&M ditched high-heeled boots in favor of sneakers and the brown candy opted for lower heels instead of stilettos. Some fans weren\\u2019t happy about the changes and took to social media to complain. \\n In a posting widely shared on social media on Monday, Mars said it was taking an \\u201cindefinite\\u201d pause on using the spokescandies. \\n \\u201cNow we get it \\u2014 even a candy\\u2019s shoes can be polarizing,\\u201d the statement said. \\u201cWhich was the last thing M&M\\u2019s wanted since we\\u2019re all about bringing people together.\\u201d \\n Mars didn\\u2019t say how long the pause would be for. Some likened the news to a publicity stunt that Planters tried in 2020 when it announced it was \\u201ckilling off\\u201d its beloved spokescharacter Mr. Peanut ahead of the game. \\n \\u201cM&Ms announcing that they\\u2019re getting rid of long-standing and (mostly) beloved mascots because of peer pressure is newsworthy,\\u201d said Steve Merino, chief dreative director at ad agency Aloysius Butler & Clark. \\u201cThat being said, many brands use their Super Bowl moment as a chance to pull a publicity stunt. Remember when Planters faked getting rid of Mr. Peanut? We\\u2019ll see if this is real, or just a thin candy shell.\\u201d \\n In Planters case, the ruse did not go seamlessly. Planters teased its Super Bowl ad nearly two weeks before the game, releasing a teaser that showed its Mr. Peanut mascot seemingly being killed. But when Kobe Bryant was killed in a helicopter crash, the marketing stunt suddenly seemed insensitive, so Planters paused its pre-game advertising. The actual Super Bowl ad was relatively inoffensive, with a baby Mr. Peanut appearing at the funeral. Planters is also returning to the Super Bowl this year for the first time since 2020, with an ad featuring Mr. Peanut. \\n The Super Bowl LVII will take place Feb. 12 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, and will be broadcast on Fox.\",\"similarity_score\":0.4322139245},{\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.msn.com\\/en-us\\/tv\\/news\\/m-m-s-taps-maya-rudolph-as-spokesperson-after-tucker-carlson-other-commentators-bash-candy-for-going-woke\\/ar-AA16EN9A?ocid=msedgdhp&cvid=0da7eb3592234f538160dddd70dc057d\",\"analyzed_text\":\"M&M\\u2019s are retreating from the use of \\u201cspokescandies\\u201d and instead deploying Maya Rudolph as a new spokesperson, after the brand\\u2019s efforts to promote diversity and inclusion triggered a backlash on the right that they were going \\u201cwoke.\\u201d \\n The brand issued a statement on Monday, saying, \\u201cAmerica, let\\u2019s talk.

After throwing a fit because two pieces of candy held hands, Tuckums went on a rant that has seemingly resulted in M&M\\u2019s doing something about the ridiculous, Fox News-stoked outrage about their spokescandy changes. The candy that has always (throughout most my life) been the small candy\\u2019s representatives. They bring us into the movies, they\\u2019ve seen Santa, and they have tried to stay uneaten through all these years. And that may be changing because of Fox News. \\n Instead of just \\u2026 not caving to Tucker Carlson and his absurd manufactured controversy over candy mascots, it seems that the company has decided to step back from the \\u201cspokescandies\\u201d as we know them. \\u201cAmerica, let\\u2019s talk,\\u201d the company\\u2019s statement, posted on Twitter, begins. \\u201cIn the last year, we\\u2019ve made some changes to our beloved spokescandies.

Is this because he had a crush on the green M&M and didn\\u2019t like that she had a girlfriend instead of dating him? \\n Could this be a bit? \\n Some on Twitter think that this could be connected to the upcoming Super Bowl, famous for commercials and no stranger to an M&M advertisement, which would be in the same vein as others before them (like the Baby Nut debacle). \\n It would be a hilarious thing. Let Fox News think they\\u2019ve won and get rid of the M&M\\u2019s for a few weeks, only to bring them back just to make them mad. Bonus points if the green M&M and brown M&M make out. Go even further! Cast them with famous voices and have them all fall in love with each other. Let Scarlett Johansson finally be the green M&M. \\n That is, if some kind of marketing ploy is what the company is doing. They could very well just be caving to the whims of Republican pundits.

On Monday, M&Ms, the cute little \\\"melts in your mouth, not in your hand\\\" candy owned by Mars Wrigley, issued one of those social-media statements usually seen when a company has really ticked consumers off. \\n \\u00a9 Provided by CNET M&Ms said in a statement that it's retiring its spokescandies, but it seems likely an upcoming Super Bowl ad might sweeten the pot. Instagram \\n \\\"America, let's talk,\\\" the message begins. It goes on to note that the colorful little candy mascots seen in the company's ads -- essentially, M&Ms with faces and limbs -- have caused internet controversy. \\n Therefore, M&Ms has \\\"decided to take an indefinite pause from the spokescandies,\\\" instead adding actress and comedian Maya Rudolph as its spokesperson. But is this for real? And what's the chocolate-coated backstory? Here we go. \\n What are the 'spokescandies'? \\n M&Ms personified their candy years ago, giving each colored candy a different voice and personality in its ads. The yellow M&M, for example, is portrayed as kind of a dim bulb. He's a peanut M&M, so it might be a play on \\\"peanut brain.\\\" The green M&M is portrayed as the sexy one, seemingly playing off an old playground joke about green M&Ms being little aphrodisiacs. The others all have slightly different personalities and appearances, and they pretty much stay consistent from ad to ad. \\n The candy has leaned hard on the spokescandies as part of their ad campaign. There's even an in-theaters ad showing the M&Ms as if they were characters in an action movie. It does double duty as a \\\"turn off your cell phone PSA.\\\" Just as the candies are about to be sent into space strapped to a rocket, a phone rings, and they scold the audience for not turning their phones off. \\n Why are they controversial? \\n The fuss mainly surrounds the green and brown candies, depicted in ads as female. It started with their footwear. (Yes, these are still cartoon candies we are talking about.) The green M&M used to be drawn in high-heeled white go-go boots, and the brown M&M in stiletto heels. Then in 2022, green's boots were replaced with white sneakers, and brown went from super-high-heeled stilettos to a flatter, lower heel. (The male candies seem to all wear clunky white saddleshoes or sneakers.) \\n Back in 2022, Fox News host Tucker Carlson mocked the changes on his show. \\n \\\"M&M's will not be satisfied until every last cartoon character is deeply unappealing and totally androgynous,\\\" Carlson said. \\\"Until the moment when you wouldn't want to have a drink with any one of them. That's the goal. When you're totally turned off, we've achieved equity. They've won.\\\" \\n Carlson decided to attack the candies again in January 2023, also calling out the orange M&M for \\\"becoming a poster boy for the mental-health crisis\\\" (the always-nervous character was said to have anxiety). He described a purple peanut M&M, a newer character, as being an \\\"obese and distinctively frumpy lesbian M&M.\\\"\\u00a0 \\n The purple, brown and green M&Ms, the only colors represented by female spokescandies, are offered together in a limited-edition candy pack that the company touts as supporting women, with a portion of profits going to organizations that are \\\"uplifting and empowering women.\\\" A graphic shown on Fox called the all-female M&M pack, \\\"woke candy.\\\" \\n Is this for real, or a publicity stunt? \\n So did this reaction inspire M&Ms to pull its candy mascot and replace them with Maya Rudolph? \\n A representative for Mars Wrigley did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But let's think this through. What's just around the corner? The Feb. 12 Super Bowl, home of outrageous commercials and flashy corporate publicity stunts. (We're tracking all the Super Bowl commercials as they're revealed.) \\n It seems fairly likely that the cute little cartoon spokescandies aren't going anywhere. Someone at Mars Wrigley is sly enough to play off the headlines that their mascots have engendered.\\u00a0 \\n Maya Rudolph will almost certainly appear in an M&Ms Super Bowl ad, but there's no way she's replacing the little animated critters for good. M&Ms is unlikely to throw away decades worth of cute, recognizable characters just because of some statements about their size, gender and footwear. \\n According to TMZ, Rudolph has confirmed that the fuss is just leading up to her Super Bowl ad.\\u00a0 And an MSNBC columnist also agrees that this is all just an advertising ploy. \\n Where have we seen this before? \\n It wouldn't be the first time a Super Bowl ad has teased at the removal of a company's mascot. In 2020, a big game commercial showed the funeral of Mr. Peanut, the mascot for Planters nuts, and the arrival of Baby Nut instead. (Baby Nut was aged up to adulthood, just like soap operas do, in 2021.) \\n And in 2019, the Mountain from Game of Thrones killed off Bud Light's mascot, the Bud Light Knight, in a Super Bowl commercial. He also returned to the world of the living in an ad shown just a few months later.

Remember two years ago when Planters \\u201ckilled\\u201d Mr. Peanut only to revive him during a Super Bowl commercial? I imagine that a similar M&M ad will feature Rudolph, likely in an M&M costume, deadpanning her frustrations to an off-camera director or some similar bit. TMZ reported that Rudolph has acknowledged it\\u2019s all about a Super Bowl ad, just hours after the original tweet was posted. \\n On the one hand, you have to ask why a Super Bowl ad campaign is even necessary. Does anyone see a pack of M&Ms in a store and think, \\u201cI wonder if these are any good.\\u201d The candy\\u2019s name recognition extends to everybody who knows at least half their ABCs. \\n The statement retiring the candy mascots says the intent is to \\u201ccreate a world where everyone feels they belong,\\u201d which is absolutely not a world that comes about by treating the ramblings of Carlson and his ilk as deserving of response. While we could be seeing a straight-faced setup for Rudolph\\u2019s satirical gifts, I\\u2019m doubtful Mars Inc. would sign off on the biting political commentary that lampooning the right\\u2019s love for made-up culture wars would require. \\n What we\\u2019re more likely to get is a corporate inversion of Carlson\\u2019s entire shtick: a focus on the trials and tribulations of \\u201cspokescandies\\u201d in a world that is sadly obsessed with \\u201cwoke-ism\\u201d before they\\u2019re thankfully returned to service promoting their and their brethren\\u2019s consumption.

The public opinions that circulate on social media can quickly become a weapon, with a relevant portion of society attacking all together a single situation, position, or brand. And this way, the simple ambition of doing something everybody can agree on becomes impossible. Up to the point that someone just gives up: it\\u2019s what happened in January 2023 to M&M, with a public statement announcing a change in the advertising policy. The new commercial will be shared on the 2023 Super Bowl, and after the controversy that triggered the public debate in 2022, the new spokesperson will be Maya Rudolph, replacing the \\u201cspokescandies\\u201d we always saw in the ads. Let\\u2019s find out what happened. \\n Maya Rudolph in the 2023 M&M Super Bowl commercial: is the controversy solved? \\n 2023 is the year when M&M announced a significant change in their advertisement policy: the famous \\u201cspokescandies\\u201d that animated the commercials so far will not appear anymore, and the new commercial will be hosted by a face that (hopefully) will dissolve any controversy: the American actress and comedian Maya Rudolph. \\n You can find here on Twitter the official announcement where M&M explained the reasons for this decision, shared on January 2023. The ultimate goal of the chocolate brand is to bring people together; although they didn\\u2019t expect that the new versions of their beloved candies would create the 2022 debate, they decided to take a break from that direction and delegate the role of spokesperson to Maya Rudolph, a TV personality everybody loves. \\n The controversy was triggered in 2022 after M&M slightly changed the appearance of green M&M, making it \\u201cless sexy.\\u201d According to someone, this was an attempt to affect female representation, and at some point, public opinion suggested that the intention was to introduce a lesbian representative. You can find an explanation of the whole controversy here on Polygon.com. \\n In other words: for some reason, the M&M commercial shared in 2022 divided the audience, which is the opposite of what a famous brand wants to do. To restore the general reputation of the brand, M&M decided to (temporarily?) retire the candies character and ask Maya Rudolph to take over, as an example of a public personality who would never say anything that could trigger controversy. \\n Who is Maya Rudolph? \\n Maya Rudolph is an American actress, comedian, and singer who\\u2019s been active since 1996. She became famous for participating in Saturday Night Live from 1999 to 2007. You can watch in this video her imitation of Beyonc\\u00e9, one of her most notable performances on SNL. \\n After she left SNL, her career as an actress and voice actress took off: she started playing minor roles in the TV shows City Of Angels and Chicago Hope, then she played in the movie 50 First Dates and was a member of the cast in the animated film Shrek the Third. \\n More recently, she was a voice in the Pixar movie Luca and played in Licorice Pizza and Disenchanted. Over the years, she won many accolades, proving her popularity in the United States. \\n Her mission is to fix a debate that sees a portion of the American audience angry against M&M commercial strategy. Not an easy goal, especially because of the predisposition that now those voices in the social networks have.

According to the Mars, Incorporated\\u2019s chocolate button candy\\u2019s official Twitter, the company has paid attention to the fact that it has somehow become a hot topic in America\\u2019s culture wars. With that in mind, the company says \\u201cwe have decided to take an indefinite pause from the spokescandies,\\u201d de facto bringing in Maya Rudolph and likely permanently retiring the anthropomorphic M&M\\u2019s characters. \\n The M&M\\u2019s Twitter post began with the fairly innocuous statement \\u201cAmerica, let\\u2019s talk. In the last year, we\\u2019ve made some changes to our beloved spokescandies\\u201d and leading to what should be a strange statement, \\u201ccandy\\u2019s shoes can be polarizing.\\u201d This is in reference to an odd focus by Fox News talk show host Tucker Carlson on changes in the shoes worn by several of the spokescandies, who were coded as female. The \\u201cGreen\\u201d M&M shifted from thigh-high boots to sneakers, while the \\u201cBrown\\u201d M&M had its heels slightly lowered, causing Carlson to declare (per Forbes) on his popular show that: \\n Given that Tucker Carlson is one of the most popular talk show hosts currently on television (as well as frequently the target of criticism for his promotion of far-right rhetoric and conspiracy theories), it is not surprising that his disapproval of the de-sexualization of a marketing campaign for candy quickly became a hot button topic. After months of criticism from various conservative pundits and mocking rebuttals from progressives, it appears that Mars, Incorporated no longer wants to bear the focus on this particular topic.\\u00a0 \\n Therefore, the widely-beloved Maya Rudolph replacing the seven current M&M\\u2019s spokescandies: the sarcastic and snide Red (currently voiced by Futurama\\u2019s Billy West), the cheerful Yellow (currently voiced by J.K. Simmons), the more chill Blue (voiced by Robb Pruitt), the formerly-seductive Green (voiced by Cree Summer and Larissa Murray), and the nervous Orange (\\u200b\\u200bEric Kirchberger).\\u00a0 \\n Since 2017, Maya Rudolph has voiced characters on the animated Netflix sitcom Big Mouth, for which she has been awarded two Primetime Emmy Awards. She also won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for portraying sitting U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday Night Live, and appeared in three seasons of the critically acclaimed NBC sitcom The Good Place, which garnered her another three nominations for a Primetime Emmy. \\n In short, Mars, Incorporated is bringing in a pretty big heavy hitter with Maya Rudolph to replace the bizarrely controversial M&M\\u2019s spokescandies. There is very little in American pop culture that cannot generate controversy in some unexpected way, but hopefully, things go a little smoother with Maya Rudolph and M&M\\u2019s.\",\"similarity_score\":0.4282312627},{\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.msn.com\\/en-us\\/tv\\/news\\/m-ms-is-replacing-animated-spokescandies-with-maya-rudolph-for-super-bowl-ad-and-the-internet-isnt-handling-things-well\\/ar-AA16Ft91\",\"analyzed_text\":\"For decades, the animated M&M's candy mascots dominated small screen ads. Whether they're fainting from seeing Santa, griping about each other in board meetings, or trying to disable a rocket, the multi-colored characters are used to bringing their shenanigans to audiences at large. This might be why so many people were immediately up in arms after the company announced the iconic spokescandies are being replaced by comedy queen Maya Rudolph for an upcoming Super Bowl ad, saying it's all an effort to sidestep past controversies.\\u00a0 \\n \\u00a9 CBS null \\n News of Maya Rudolph's partnership with the M&M's brand came via a statement from the company that was shared on Instagram. The message explaining the surprising switch-up alluded to consumer reactions to various changes made to the characters in recent years, such as the Green M&M's design changing to tone down perceived-as-sexual details, as well as the introduction of the Purple M&M. According to the press release, the company is putting the mascots on an \\\"indefinite pause\\\" and opting to move forward with Rudolph in their place. It all seem a bit too tongue in cheek to be real, and yet... \\n While appearing on Today, Rudolph teased that \\\"lots of fun\\\" will be had in regards to the upcoming Super Bowl ad, and shared how she felt to be the brand's \\\"Chief of Fun\\\" spokesperson, saying: \\n M&M is known for its creative advertising and for using well-known celebrities like Danny DeVito for Super Bowl ads. It's no shock they'd enlist a multi-hyphenate talent like Maya Rudolph, but certainly still wild to hear the mascots won't be involved in any way. While it's possible this is all an intentional plan to drum up more interest ahead of the ad, some on the internet are not too happy to hear this news and want answers:\\u00a0 \\n There's definitely a lot of confusion all around with this news, even beyond the decision to withhold the mascots. There's no denying Maya Rudolph is a beloved comedy icon with scores of memorable moments on Saturday Night Live and plenty of other great performances on TV and in film. Still, there's also no denying other celebrities may have been more obvious spokespersons for M&M's, if any such people could please stand up.\\u00a0 \\n Maybe the price for Eminem went up after last year's elaborate Super Bowl halftime performance. In either case, Maya Rudolph is the new face of M&M's going forward, and the one group we haven't heard from would be the replaced M&M's mascots. The chocolate-filled toons haven't made any formal kind of statement at this time, but there are those on the internet who think they know how they're feeling:\\u00a0 \\n The online discourse about this situation, which features a lot of confusing opinions, has understandably left some to question why so many others are up in arms. Cyanide and Happiness creator Rob DenBleyker is one of those that had trouble making heads or tails of what he saw, and needed some help from followers to understand:\\u00a0 \\n I don't blame anyone who is confused, as there's a deep mix of serious and silly reactions to the M&M news, making it a bit disorienting to navigate. Then you take all that and throw in the folks just making surreal memes to further enable chaos, and this situation has really gotten out of control:\\u00a0 \\n The world could really use a mustachioed M&M with the scripted wisdom of a talk show host like Dr. Phil right now, but I wouldn't count on seeing anything like that at the Super Bowl. This whole situation has devolved into a real mess online, so I can only imagine how cord-cutters armed with only a Netflix subscription and years of not watching ads are navigating this right now.\\u00a0 \\n I personally think the M&M characters will appear, and this is just another attention-grabbing pre-Super Bowl ad stunt similar to Ben Affleck selling Dunkin Donuts coffee. I guess we'll see when the big game arrives and if people react even more unexpectedly if the mascots were indeed nixed.\\u00a0 \\n Those who live for Super Bowl ads but don't actually follow sports can get set to binge on some of the highest-quality (read as: expensive) commercials of the year on Fox on Sunday, February 12th. I'm excited to check out M&M's upcoming ad, and am hoping it'll at least measure up to some of the best commercials from last year's big game.\",\"similarity_score\":0.3970961387},{\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.hitc.com\\/en-gb\\/2023\\/01\\/24\\/what-does-polarizing-figure-mean-as-mms-pauses-spokescandies\\/?authId=1*1yuzabz*_a*cEMwZlpCMURsaWZHX3kzZjZlZlRZOUxPUWRnT3AtR2NaTk01YkNWOUgtX2RyRkR3cm9vRmtsemhzcXctYk55YQ..\",\"analyzed_text\":\"In a statement issued in response to the cultural war it\\u2019s embroiled in, M&M\\u2019s said it has realized even a candy\\u2019s shoe can be viewed as a \\u201cpolarizing\\u201d figure, but what does that mean? \\n Mars was a lot in the news in 2022 for bringing about a few changes to its spokescandies, which were subtle, yet thought-evoking. \\n However, the commentary by Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson about the M&M\\u2019s being \\u201cwoke\\u201d last year reportedly prompted the brand to shelve their spokescandies indefinitely. \\n What does a polarizing figure mean? \\n Polarizing refers to causing something, especially a group of people or opinions, to divide into completely opposing groups.

The long famous \\u201cspokescandies\\u201d are to be retired amid ongoing (and surprising) outrage from conservative media personalities, notably\\u00a0Fox News\\u2019 Tucker Carlson. \\n Though the criticism may seem trivial,\\u00a0Fox News remains the most watched non-sports cable network, reaching 1.49 million viewers as of 2022. This left Mars, the parent company of M&Ms, with a large audience to answer to. Ahead of the Super Bowl, a sporting event known for its ad placements, M&Ms announced a big change\\u2013comedian Maya Rudolph is now their spokesperson. \\n While Rudolph\\u2019s fans were excited for her, others were quick to criticize the brand\\u2019s choice to adhere to absurd conservative claims about their advertising. The green M&M was the initial topic of conversation, with some of the brand\\u2019s market research alleging that viewers felt the M&M was too sexualized. This resulted in a change of footwear, which then sparked further backlash from right wing media personalities. \\n You might be asking, how did we get here? Here\\u2019s a definitive timeline of events in the M&M saga. \\n A History of the Green M&M \\n The M&Ms spokescandies actually all began as gender neutral in original ad campaigns from the 60s to the 90s. \\n The candy\\u2019s unique quality was its coating that made it an easy on-the-go snack for children to take to movie theaters or school. \\n The green M&M was reintroduced as a woman in 1997, a popular move for the brand that would later create controversy. Gen Z has a specific nostalgia for the female version of the Green M&M, as it was used in ads in the early 00\\u2019s. This of course has led many to take to TikTok amid the recent news. \\n In January 2022, the Green M&Ms heeled white boots were swapped for white sneakers as a part of a company wide mission for inclusivity. This led to a lot of mixed reactions\\u2013some didn\\u2019t feel like it was necessary in the first place, while others were outraged at what conservative media personalities like Tucker Carlson have coined \\u201cthe woke agenda.\\u201d \\n In retrospect, the real controversy was never about the shoes, but what they stood for. The 2021 Super Bowl ad for M&Ms, which featured several celebrities, revealed that the brown and green M&Ms, both women, were a couple. \\n The internet (and Fox News) had a lot to say about that. \\n Many thought that the addition of the LGBTQ+ storyline into the M&Ms ad campaigns was a positive and heartfelt decision that showed progress in mainstream advertising. \\n Fox News hosts were quick to criticize the decision. The network has come under fire in recent years for its racist and homophobic coverage of news and cultural discussions.\\u00a0In the comments on M&Ms announcement today, some criticized their decision to stay neutral as indirectly catering to Tucker Carlson and\\u00a0Fox. \\n Others were quick to point out the hypocrisy of Carlson, who frequently refers to people who point out controversies in the entertainment world related to women, BIPOC and LGBTQ+ people as \\u201csnowflakes\\u201d for being too sensitive. His comments fit his own definition of the term. \\n Others took a look at Carlson\\u2019s previous comments on the brand and pointed out how strange it was to be sexualizing a children\\u2019s cartoon character. \\n The hypocrisy of the whole situation trends on Twitter today. \\n Influencer and activist Matt Bernstein put together a video compilation of several clips in which Fox News hosts get into heated discussions about the M&Ms. \\n Others theorized that the spokescandies are not really gone\\u2013that the Super Bowl ad will include Maya Rudolph alongside the candies as they unionize. \\n Others reacted to the situation with satirical humor, commenting on Carlson\\u2019s repeat comments. \\n Others used pop culture moments to point out the memeable quality of the situation. \\n Aside from LGBTQ+ and plus sized M&Ms who wear high heels, the parent company faces a much larger controversy. Mars, Nestl\\u00e9 and Hershey are embroiled in ongoing child slavery lawsuits. In 2021, eight children claimed they were used in slave labor on cacoa plantations on the Ivory Coast in West Africa. \\n The current advertising debacle is shining a light on the suit, which had previously received little social media attention. \\n Fox News notoriously comments disparagingly about diverse communities, which is why some TikTok creators theorize they haven\\u2019t discussed the ongoing child slavery lawsuit. \\n Slavery in the chocolate industry remains a major global issue, with an estimated 23% of the population of the Ivory Coast and Ghana enslaved on cocoa plantations. These areas supply cocoa to roughly 70% of the world. \\n This issue has paved way for the fair trade food industry, which provides an ethical solution to the constant need for cocoa supply. \\n After a day of mass internet reactions to the M&Ms situation, Carlson responded on his show this evening. He referred to the candies as \\u201cneurotic\\u201d and \\u201cfrumpy,\\u201d essentially standing by his initial opinions surrounding the candies. Carlson concluded the segment with several fat-phobic and homophobic comments. \\n Given this clip from tonight\\u2019s show, it\\u2019s likely that LGBTQ+ storylines in adve\",\"similarity_score\":0.3863530251},{\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/chicago.suntimes.com\\/taste\\/2023\\/1\\/23\\/23568404\\/m-ms-replacing-spokescandies-with-maya-rudolph-super-bowl-ad-social-media-fallout\",\"analyzed_text\":\"M&M\\u2019s announced Monday it is putting its iconic characters on an \\u201cindefinite pause\\u201d and replacing them with actress Maya Rudolph after controversy following its mascot makeover last year.\\u00a0 \\n The brand said it didn\\u2019t expect the changes to their \\u201cspokescandies,\\u201d the colorful cartoon M&M\\u2019s mascots, would \\u201cbreak the internet,\\u201d noting that \\u201ceven a candy\\u2019s shoes can be polarizing.\\u201d \\n \\u201cIn the last year, we\\u2019ve made some changes to our beloved spokescandies,\\u201d \\n M&M\\u2019s said in a statement on Twitter. \\u201cWe weren\\u2019t sure if anyone would even notice.

They have thin, fragile shells that can\\u2019t quite keep them from smearing their messy innards all over everything. I\\u2019m speaking, of course, about conservative commentators who have meltdowns over cartoon portrayals of candy. \\n This is the curious case of M&Ms, thrust into the crosshairs of the culture wars after parent company Mars Inc. made changes to its characters last year. The anthropomorphized M&Ms now had updated looks and \\u201cmore nuanced personalities,\\u201d it announced in a press release. What was wrong with the old ones? Apparently the red one was a bit of a bully; it would now be kind. The green and brown M&Ms, both female-presenting, sometimes cut each other down; now they\\u2019d be supportive friends (maybe even more than friends?). The orange one, who had poorly concealed anxiety, would \\u201cembrace his true self, worries and all.\\u201d The brand later added a purple M&M, \\u201cdesigned to represent acceptance and inclusivity.\\u201d The campaign might have been well intentioned. But it was also irresistible comic material, and Twitter users of all political persuasions promptly mined it. \\n Then the moment might have passed, if Fox News host Tucker Carlson hadn\\u2019t sunk his teeth in. You see, the green M&M \\u2014 formerly wearing high-heeled, knee-high boots \\u2014 now sported sneakers. The brown one ditched her stilettos for block heels. This didn\\u2019t work at all for Carlson, who deemed the old footwear of the children\\u2019s candy \\u201csexy\\u201d and the new \\u201csensible\\u201d: \\u201cM&Ms will not be satisfied until every last cartoon character is deeply unappealing and totally androgynous \\u2014 until the moment you wouldn\\u2019t want to have a drink with any one of them,\\u201d he said to his more than 3 million viewers without an ounce of embarrassment. \\u201cWhen you\\u2019re totally turned off, we\\u2019ve achieved equity.\\u201d \\n This is a moment when I think it best to take Carlson at his word. He was simply very sad he was no longer aroused by a cartoon M&M and her sexy, sexy boots. (Aw honey, there are websites for that.) \\n It had nothing at all to do with Mars Inc.\\u2019s stated desire to create a more inclusive world, putting resources into diversity audits, initiatives aimed at gender balance in leadership, and so on. It had nothing at all to do with being triggered by a corporation\\u2019s \\u201cglobal commitment to creating a world where everyone feels they belong.\\u201d Was M&Ms being \\u201cwoke,\\u201d as Carlson had it, or simply pragmatic? In the United States, the population is projected to become minority white over the next 25 years. Future consumers look increasingly less like Carlson. In 2022, M&Ms were the most popular Halloween candy, according to shopping and delivery service Shipt\\u2019s Halloween Trend Report. Let\\u2019s keep it that way, amirite M&Ms? \\n Oh, maybe. On Monday, the brand announced it would step away indefinitely from its \\u201cbeloved spokescandies,\\u201d introducing an actual human spokesperson instead \\u2014 comedian Maya Rudolph, daughter of a Black mother (singer-songwriter Minnie Riperton) and a Jewish father, who on \\u201cSaturday Night Live\\u201d has portrayed Kamala Harris, the country\\u2019s first woman vice president, also multiracial. I am honestly not sure at this point who is getting pranked, but M&Ms has gotten a heck of a lot of attention this week, and Carlson continues to tweet gleefully about \\u201cfrumpy, plus-sized, and lesbian M&Ms.\\u201d (It seems he perceives Purple\\u2019s peanut shape as \\u2026 obesity?) There is speculation this is all some kind of lead-up to M&Ms\\u2019 Super Bowl commercial, which would conclude the whole saga with a real end-times capitalist chef\\u2019s kiss. I for one am hoping for an ad where Rudolph and the full coterie of inclusive candies sing a show-stopping number about the beauty of diversity, wearing nothing but sexytime boots. \\n But is this a food story? Of course it is. \\u201cI\\u2019ll NEVER give up my gas stove,\\u201d Texas Republican and noted cook Ronny Jackson recently tweeted, stoking outrage over a ban-that-wasn\\u2019t. \\u201cIf the maniacs in the White House come for my stove, they can pry it from my cold dead hands. COME AND TAKE IT!!\\u201d And Iowa House Republicans showed how much they care about hunger by sponsoring a bill that would severely restrict Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program purchases: no more fresh meat, sliced cheese, or white rice, bread, and pasta, among other staples. \\n Food is a human necessity, a powerful symbol, and a pawn for posturing policymakers. When the media put Carlson on blast for his M&Ms commentary, he said: \\u201cThey just can\\u2019t stand the idea that candy isn\\u2019t political.\\u201d This is a moment when it\\u2019s best not to take him at his word.

On the M&M package that you\\u2019re guzzling down lonely in your apartment with your wine and your cats? How\\u2019s that going for you?\\u201d \\n Last year, many also mocked the company for trying to make its characters more inclusive and essentially for taking itself too seriously. \\n At the time, Fox News Host Tucker Carlson derogatorily deemed the candies the \\u201cmiserable, non-binary \\u201d characters that are \\u201call we deserve.\\u201d \\n \\u201cThe other big change is that the brown M&M has \\u2018transitioned from high stilettos to lower block heels,\\u2019 also less sexy,\\u201d he continued, \\u201cThat\\u2019s progress.

Whether they're fainting from seeing Santa, griping about each other in board meetings, or trying to disable a rocket, the multi-colored characters are used to bringing their shenanigans to audiences at large. This might be why so many people were immediately up in arms after the company announced the iconic spokescandies are being replaced by comedy queen Maya Rudolph for an upcoming Super Bowl ad, saying it's all an effort to sidestep past controversies.\\u00a0 \\n News of Maya Rudolph's partnership with the M&M's brand came via a statement from the company that was shared on Instagram. The message explaining the surprising switch-up alluded to consumer reactions to various changes made to the characters in recent years, such as the Green M&M's design changing to tone down perceived-as-sexual details, as well as the introduction of the Purple M&M. According to the press release, the company is putting the mascots on an \\\"indefinite pause\\\" and opting to move forward with Rudolph in their place. It all seem a bit too tongue in cheek to be real, and yet... \\n While appearing on Today, Rudolph teased that \\\"lots of fun\\\" will be had in regards to the upcoming Super Bowl ad, and shared how she felt to be the brand's \\\"Chief of Fun\\\" spokesperson, saying: \\n M&M is known for its creative advertising and for using well-known celebrities like Danny DeVito for Super Bowl ads. It's no shock they'd enlist a multi-hyphenate talent like Maya Rudolph, but certainly still wild to hear the mascots won't be involved in any way. While it's possible this is all an intentional plan to drum up more interest ahead of the ad, some on the internet are not too happy to hear this news and want answers:\\u00a0 \\n There's definitely a lot of confusion all around with this news, even beyond the decision to withhold the mascots. There's no denying Maya Rudolph is a beloved comedy icon with scores of memorable moments on Saturday Night Live and plenty of other great performances on TV and in film. Still, there's also no denying other celebrities may have been more obvious spokespersons for M&M's, if any such people could please stand up.\\u00a0 \\n Maybe the price for Eminem went up after last year's elaborate Super Bowl halftime performance. In either case, Maya Rudolph is the new face of M&M's going forward, and the one group we haven't heard from would be the replaced M&M's mascots. The chocolate-filled toons haven't made any formal kind of statement at this time, but there are those on the internet who think they know how they're feeling:\\u00a0 \\n The online discourse about this situation, which features a lot of confusing opinions, has understandably left some to question why so many others are up in arms. Cyanide and Happiness creator Rob DenBleyker is one of those that had trouble making heads or tails of what he saw, and needed some help from followers to understand:\\u00a0 \\n I don't blame anyone who is confused, as there's a deep mix of serious and silly reactions to the M&M news, making it a bit disorienting to navigate. Then you take all that and throw in the folks just making surreal memes to further enable chaos, and this situation has really gotten out of control:\\u00a0 \\n The world could really use a mustachioed M&M with the scripted wisdom of a talk show host like Dr. Phil right now, but I wouldn't count on seeing anything like that at the Super Bowl. This whole situation has devolved into a real mess online, so I can only imagine how cord-cutters armed with only a Netflix subscription and years of not watching ads are navigating this right now.\\u00a0 \\n I personally think the M&M characters will appear, and this is just another attention-grabbing pre-Super Bowl ad stunt similar to Ben Affleck selling Dunkin Donuts coffee. I guess we'll see when the big game arrives and if people react even more unexpectedly if the mascots were indeed nixed.\\u00a0 \\n Those who live for Super Bowl ads but don't actually follow sports can get set to binge on some of the highest-quality (read as: expensive) commercials of the year on Fox on Sunday, February 12th. I'm excited to check out M&M's upcoming ad, and am hoping it'll at least measure up to some of the best commercials from last year's big game.\",\"similarity_score\":0.346850578},{\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.aol.com\\/entertainment\\/m-ms-says-replacing-beloved-170220434.html?utm_source=spotim&utm_medium=spotim_conversation&spot_im_redirect_source=notifications&spot_im_comment_id=sp_IjnMf2Jd_77722ed9-842c-342f-b0a7-0cdc1ed92f03_c_2Km9xaKk18iwjT1v2uvSked6SZe&spot_im_highlight_immediate=true\",\"analyzed_text\":\"Looks like America's ongoing candy wars may have claimed more victims.

In January, Purple joined the other female spokescandies, Brown and Green, on an all-female M&M's package that was designed to \\\"celebrate women everywhere who are flipping the status quo.\\\" (Mars announced that a portion of sales would be donated to nonprofit organizations like She is the Music and We Are Moving the Needle.) \\n Conservative critics on outlets like Fox News immediately took issue with the campaign, suggesting that M&M's had gone \\\"woke.\\\" Meanwhile, Fox News' Tucker Carlson took issue with the more empowered depiction of the female spokescandies, complaining that Purple appeared \\\"plus-sized\\\" and suggesting that the Green character was coded as a lesbian. While Carlson's objections inspired some trolling on social media, his argument improbably took root in conservative media circles and may have influenced Mars's decision to relegate the M&M's spokescandies to the sidelines. In their Twitter statement, the brand notably suggested that the recent decisions have been \\\"polarizing,\\\" adding: \\\"We're all about bringing people together.\\\" \\n On Twitter, M&M fans are certainly suggesting that the brand has bowed to Carlson and his candy-related rants. \\n At the same time, others are noting that the timing of this announcement is conveniently close to the Super Bowl, when brands are looking to capitalize on the exposure that ad-friendly event brings. Certainly, the idea of using the Super Bowl to replace a longtime animated mascot has been tried in the past \\u2014 most famously during the famous Mr. Peanut\\/Baby Peanut debacle of 2020.\",\"similarity_score\":0.2857177326},{\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.the-sun.com\\/news\\/7206202\\/maya-rudolph-spokesperson-mm-company-break-candy-mascots\\/\",\"analyzed_text\":\"M&M has announced an \\\"indefinite pause\\\" from using its candy mascots, sparking outrage among fans of the decades-old cartoon spokespeople. \\n The company vowed to take a break from using its candy characters as M&M acknowledged on Twitter that \\\"even candy's shoes can be polarizing.\\\" \\n In the tweet, M&M said actress and singer Maya Rudolph will take over as the new brand spokesperson, calling her someone who \\\"America can agree on.\\\" \\n \\\"We are confident Ms. Rudolph will champion the power of fun to create a world where everyone feels they belong,\\\" M&M continued in the tweet. \\n Rudolph is \\u201cthrilled\\u201d to represent the brand in a Super Bowl ad on February 12, she told TODAY.com. \\n \\\"I am a lifelong lover of the candy and I feel like it\\u2019s such an honor to be asked to be part of such a legendary brand\\u2019s campaign,\\\" she said. \\n The company's so-called \\\"spokescandies\\\" have riled up news outlets like Fox News in recent weeks after the company announced a new Flip the Status Quo campaign. \\n The campaign was meant to celebrate\\u00a0International Women's Day by raising money to support women in music with its first-ever packs featuring three M&M female characters. \\n In recent broadcasts, Fox News host Tucker Carlson\\u00a0ragged on\\u00a0\\\"woke M&Ms\\\" following similar complaints he made about the candy last year when M&M announced an \\\"inclusive\\\" look. \\n With more than 2,000 retweets, M&M's Twitter announcement provoked a lot of debate. \\n Jason Rantz, a conservative radio personality, replied, saying: \\\"You mean, your sales dipped after going woke and you don\\u2019t want to admit it outright?\\\" \\n \\\"This is worse than the woke spokescandies,\\\" another Twitter user said. \\\"Stop trying so hard.\\\" \\n \\\"I am a kind human but honestly I must say, this is a very special kind of stupid,\\\" another Twitter user replied. \\n \\\"What a way to destroy a history of making people smile,\\\" wrote another. \\n \\\"Your CEO should step down for choosing to virtue signal rather than put the investors first.\\\"\",\"similarity_score\":0.4441267653},{\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/patriotnewsfeed.com\\/tucker-carlson-melts-down-over-woke-mms-watch\\/?utm_source=spotim&utm_medium=spotim_recirculation&spot_im_redirect_source=pitc&spot_im_comment_id=sp_7uOe6hIl_11309_c_2KlzMhlc06Ep2CGYBeg4eMcAJ3w&spot_im_highlight_immediate=true\",\"analyzed_text\":\"M&M\\u2019s candy has put their usually lovable mascots on a hiatus after the \\u201cnew and fresh\\u201d spokescandies started getting criticism from conservatives like Tucker Carlson.\\u00a0 \\n The popular Fox News host criticized the new candy campaign for being \\u201cwoke.\\u201d \\n M&M began a limited edition packaging campaign that featured slogans like \\u201cSupporting Women\\u201d and they used images of the brown, green, and newly added purple female spokes candies taking feminist platforms.

Then earlier this month the company celebrated Women\\u2019s Day by flipping the Ms in its logo upside down to look like Ws \\u2014 a typographical trick that McDonald\\u2019s utilized five years ago. \\n Fox News derisively deemed the brand \\u201cwoke\\u201d after the brand altered the characters\\u2019 shoes.

Even Merriam Webster weighed in, tweeting that \\u201cspokescandies\\u201d is not in the dictionary. \\n Last year, M&M\\u2019S unveiled a new look for all of its anthropomorphized chocolate characters to make them more relevant to young consumers. \\n Most of the updates were subtle. But the change to Green\\u2019s shoes, from go-go boots to sneakers, caused outrage on social media, with many bemoaning the loss of the character\\u2019s signature look.\\u00a0A petition\\u00a0to \\u201ckeep the green M&M sexy\\u201d garnered over 20,000 signatures. (M&M\\u2019S didn\\u2019t heed the plea, but did note in its statement on Monday that \\u201ceven a candy\\u2019s shoes can be polarizing,\\u201d adding that \\u201cwas the last thing M&M\\u2019S wanted since we\\u2019re all about bringing people together.\\u201d) \\n And then in September, M&M\\u2019S\\u00a0announced another change: A new female character, Purple, was joining the lineup (but not actual bags of candy) in another effort to make the group of spokescandies more inclusive. Purple was recently deployed as part of a limited-edition pack of purple, brown and green M&M\\u2019S \\u2014 the colors of the female spokescandies \\u2014 in honor of International Women\\u2019s Day. \\n That move\\u00a0prompted another round of criticism. \\n \\u201cIf this is what you need for validation, an M&M that is the color that you think is associated with feminism, then I\\u2019m worried about you,\\u201d Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum said, adding that the move emboldened China. \\u201cI think that makes China say, \\u2018Oh, good, keep focusing on that. Keep focusing on giving people their own color M&M\\u2019S while we take over all of the mineral deposits in the entire world.'\\u201d \\n A graphic on a Fox show even called the candy \\u201cwoke.\\u201d \\n Jane Hwang, Global Vice President of M&M\\u2019S,\\u00a0previously told CNN\\u00a0that the reaction to Green\\u2019s change was \\u201cunprecedented\\u201d and that \\u201cwe were incredibly overwhelmed.\\u201d \\n But, she said at the time, \\u201cnow we know for certain that M&M\\u2019S is a cultural icon.\\u201d \\n \\u2122 & \\u00a9 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It\\u2019s all thanks to outcry from the likes of Tucker Carlson and the right-wing social media. Mars, the owners of the M&M candy, have decided to give the mascots a rest for the foreseeable future. They\\u2019re replacement is comedian and Saturday Night Live alum Maya Rudolph is due to start during the run up to the Super Bowl, but it\\u2019s likely Carlson and the conservative outlets will still be upset. \\n The M&Ms mascots underwent changes earlier last year in order to be more inclusive. Some of the characters went through design tweaks, including a change to the green M&M\\u2019s knee-high boots, which upset more people than you\\u2019d have thought it would. New spokescandies were also added, including an anxious orange M&M and a purple peanut M&M. Now the company behind the candy has had another change of direction.\\u00a0 \\n Mars made the announcement via their Twitter account yesterday afternoon. The post directly alludes to the outcry from the right-wing press regarding the \\u201cwoke\\u201d nature of the spokescandies redesigns. One of the most vocal dissenters was\\u2014you guessed it\\u2014Fox news anchor Tucker Carlson, who ranted against the liberal agenda somehow ruining the M&Ms brand. Carlson made a point of attacking the brand on numerous occasions for the way they were marketing the candy. \\n While some have criticized Mars for giving in to the pressure from right-wing outlets, many have praised Rudolph\\u2019s hiring. Others theorized that the tweet was a ploy to stir the waters and drum up chatter leading up to the super-bowl. \\n Maya herself has said that she\\u2019s excited to be a part of the campaign. Like most normal humans, she hasn\\u2019t been upset by the \\u201cwoke\\u201d spokescandies, or at least she hasn\\u2019t been as vocal about it as Carlson. The comedian\\u2019s political views are pretty much the opposite of the Fox news anchor.\\u00a0In all likelihood, the conservative press will still find issue with the company\\u2019s choice to make Rudolph their spokesperson. After all, she is a strong supporter of feminism and equality and seems like a great choice to step in for the M&Ms spokescandies. \\n Does she look familiar, but you can\\u2019t quite pin down where you\\u2019ve seen her? Although she has been appearing on SNL since 2000, Rudolph\\u2019s impression of Vice President Kamala Harris has been a hit with audiences and won the comedian an Emmy. Her role as Harris even won the approval of the veep herself. \\n For now, it seems like the M&M mascots are out, and Maya Rudolph is in. It\\u2019s probable the spokescandies won\\u2019t be gone for long. Mars has already released a teaser image for the Super Bowl ad campaign showing the silhouettes of the M&Ms lined up on the pitch. Unless they\\u2019re being lined up for a firing squad, we\\u2019ll likely see them again.\",\"similarity_score\":0.2976231192},{\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.kitv.com\\/news\\/national\\/maya-rudolph-is-the-new-face-of-m-ms-polarizing-spokescandies-are-taking-a-pause\\/article_df83d7ca-17e1-51f0-aea5-f35ba349345c.html\",\"analyzed_text\":\"After causing outrage by making over the Green M&M and launching a special bag featuring its new Purple character in honor of International Women's Day, M&M'S says it is taking a step back from its candy reps \\u2014 sort of. \\n \\\"In the last year, we've made some changes to our beloved spokescandies,\\\" the chocolate candy brand said in a statement Monday. \\\"We weren't sure if anyone would even notice.

In January 2021, conservative pundit and culture warrior Tucker Carlson lost his mind over a different M&M\\u2019s advertising campaign, in which the female-coded candies swapped their knee-high boots and stiletto heels for more practical footwear.\\u00a0 \\n \\u201cM&M\\u2019s will not be satisfied until every last cartoon character is deeply unappealing and totally androgynous,\\u201d Carlson said during a rant about the change. \\u201cUntil the moment you wouldn\\u2019t want to have a drink with any one of them. That\\u2019s the goal. When you are totally turned off, we\\u2019ve achieved equity.\\u201d \\n Naturally, the clip of Carlson saying this went extremely viral and was endlessly dunked on, including by California congressman Eric Swalwell, who tweeted, \\u201cYou\\u2026 wanted to have a drink\\u2026 with an M&M? #DeeperIssues\\u201d \\n In early January, of this year the M&M\\u2019s brand announced new packaging that only featured green, brown, and purple candies (the femme versions of the characters) alongside a contest for consumers to nominate inspirational women for a chance to win $10,000. \\n The M&M\\u2019s company said that the campaign was \\u201ccelebrating women across the country who are flipping the status quo.\\u201d\\u00a0 \\n Shortly after that announcement, Carlson again caught onto this news and was not pleased.\\u00a0 \\n In a segment on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson noted that the green M&M is \\u201cnow a lesbian maybe,\\u201d referring to a years-old tweet about the green and brown ones, and that the purple M&M is \\u201cobese.\\u201d (All of the M&M characters are shaped like round candies with stick legs and arms.)\\u00a0 \\n All of this, including M&M\\u2019s announcement to put the characters out of their misery, is part of an endless cycle of brands versus outrage jockeys, locked in a battle for relevance. With the Super Bowl two weeks away, we could be looking at another Mr. Peanut situation, where the spokesnut died as part of a Super Bowl ad campaign, and was then reborn as a baby nut. \\n Inclusion-pandering from a company that makes $40 billion a year isn\\u2019t actually helpful to real-life, non-candy coated, marginalized human beings\\u2014a point Carlson could make if he thought slightly deeper about the topic.

Republicans and Fox News, of course. In today\\u2019s world, absolutely everything is politicized, including candy. It\\u2019s ridiculous. \\n Anthropomorphized candy characters are not real. They are marketing tools. That shouldn\\u2019t need to be said. However, a year ago in January 2022, M&M\\u2019s parent company, Mars Inc., announced a makeover for the candy characters. They would have \\u201cmore nuanced personalities to underscore the importance of self-expression and power of community through storytelling.\\u201d You can\\u2019t make this stuff up. An uproar on social media was created when consumers discovered that the green M&M would not longer wear her go-go boots, which were replaced with sneakers. \\n That means giving the M&M\\u2019s arms and legs that match their shell colors, instead of the tan flesh tone the previous version had. The two female characters will wear less stereotypically feminine attire now, as well \\u2014 the brown M&M\\u2019s heels have been lowered to sensible pumps, and in lieu of her signature go-go boots, the green M&M now sports a pair of \\u201ccool, laid-back sneakers to reflect her effortless confidence.\\u201d \\n The company said the new look is part of its \\u201cglobal commitment to creating a world where everyone feels they belong and society is inclusive.\\u201d \\n Who thought it was a good idea to go woke with M&Ms? Earlier this month Mars announced that for Valentine\\u2019s Day, the company is opting for a marketing campaign of limited edition \\u201call-female\\u201d M&Ms candy packages. The packages honor women who are \\u201cflipping the status quo.\\u201d \\n The company announced the feminist-forward candy wrappers Thursday, saying it will exclusively display M&M\\u2019s female characters: the green, brown and most recently introduced purple M&M. \\n So, that nonsense was after the debate over a \\u2018sexy\\u2019 green M&M. What is wrong with people? It\\u2019s candy. Marketing people are being paid to come up with this slop. Press about the female M&Ms campaign became an avenue for the media to trash Fox News and Tucker Carlson for commenting on the absurdity of wokeness in candy products. \\n M&M\\u2019s \\u201cspokescandies\\u201d have provoked the ire of right-wing outlets like Fox News in recent weeks after the company announced a new \\u201cFlip the Status Quo\\u201c campaign. The campaign raised money to support women in creative industries and featured limited-edition candy bags with the three female spokescandies. \\n Fox News host Tucker Carlson railed against \\u201cwoke M&Ms\\u201d in a recent broadcast. He made similar complaints about the candies last January after M&M\\u2019s announced a new, inclusive look. \\n In its statement on Monday, M&M\\u2019s said it \\u201cdefinitely didn\\u2019t think it would break the internet.\\u201d \\n \\u201cBut now we get it \\u2014 even a candy\\u2019s shoes can be polarizing,\\u201d the brand wrote. \\u201cWhich is the last thing M&M\\u2019s wanted since we\\u2019re all about bringing people together.\\u201d \\n Now a decision has been made to do away with the spokescandies and bring in actress Maya Rudolph. I like Maya Rudolph. The spokescandies are taking an \\u2018indefinite pause.\\u2019 \\n Is it a candy company\\u2019s job to \\u201cbring people together?\\u201d I thought that the Mars family who owns the private company were conservative people. There seems to be an identity crisis going on here. Most likely, the woke vibes didn\\u2019t go over very well with consumers. No one needs to be lectured to about being woke by candy. \\n Our sister site, Twitchy, has some good tweets that express how most people likely feel about this craziness. \\n Mars is a private company and they can do what they want to do. But, man, someone needs to get a handle on how they should market their candy. Sales must have dropped. \\n Maya Rudolph will be good for sales. I\\u2019m partial to peanut M&Ms. I can assure you that the spokescandies are not a consideration when I purchase a bag. All of this nonsense is lost on me, and I imagine I am not alone.

That's the goal. When you're totally turned off, we've achieved equity. They've won.\\\" \\n The candy's new look was not exactly at the top of Carlson's concerns \\u2014 the clip received some mockery from his political opponents, and most people moved on. But this month, Carlson declared that the \\\"woke M&M's have returned\\\" after Mars Wrigley introduced a new, purple M&M to the roster, and the others got a new look. \\n \\\"The green M&M's got her boots back but apparently is now a lesbian, maybe, and there is also a plus-sized, obese purple M&M,\\\" he said. \\\"So we're going to cover that, of course.

The green M&M ditched high-heeled boots in favor of sneakers and the brown candy opted for lower heels instead of stilettos.

Planters teased its Super Bowl ad nearly two weeks before the game, releasing a teaser that showed its Mr. Peanut mascot seemingly being killed. But when Kobe Bryant was killed in a helicopter crash, the marketing stunt suddenly seemed insensitive, so Planters paused its pre-game advertising.

Mars hasn\\u2019t disclosed any other creative details about the ad. \\n The Super Bowl is advertising\\u2019s biggest stage, with big-name brands pulling out all the stops and paying millions for a 30-second ad in an effort to capture the attention of the more than 100 million viewers that watch the game live. Many spend millions more on marketing campaigns leading up to the big event. \\n Mars revamped the M&M candies last year. which are featured in red, green, orange, yellow, brown and blue, to give them more nuanced personalities. The green M&M ditched high-heeled boots in favor of sneakers and the brown candy opted for lower heels instead of stilettos. Some fans weren\\u2019t happy about the changes and took to social media to complain. \\n In a posting widely shared on social media on Monday, Mars said it was taking an \\u201cindefinite\\u201d pause on using the spokescandies. \\n \\u201cNow we get it \\u2014 even a candy\\u2019s shoes can be polarizing,\\u201d the statement said. \\u201cWhich was the last thing M&M\\u2019s wanted since we\\u2019re all about bringing people together.\\u201d \\n Mars didn\\u2019t say how long the pause would be for. Some likened the news to a publicity stunt that Planters tried in 2020 when it announced it was \\u201ckilling off\\u201d its beloved spokescharacter Mr. Peanut ahead of the game. \\n \\u201cM&Ms announcing that they\\u2019re getting rid of long-standing and (mostly) beloved mascots because of peer pressure is newsworthy,\\u201d said Steve Merino, chief dreative director at ad agency Aloysius Butler & Clark. \\u201cThat being said, many brands use their Super Bowl moment as a chance to pull a publicity stunt. Remember when Planters faked getting rid of Mr. Peanut? We\\u2019ll see if this is real, or just a thin candy shell.\\u201d \\n In Planters case, the ruse did not go seamlessly. Planters teased its Super Bowl ad nearly two weeks before the game, releasing a teaser that showed its Mr. Peanut mascot seemingly being killed. But when Kobe Bryant was killed in a helicopter crash, the marketing stunt suddenly seemed insensitive, so Planters paused its pre-game advertising. The actual Super Bowl ad was relatively inoffensive, with a baby Mr. Peanut appearing at the funeral. Planters is also returning to the Super Bowl this year for the first time since 2020, with an ad featuring Mr. Peanut. \\n The Super Bowl LVII will take place Feb. 12 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, and will be broadcast on Fox.\",\"similarity_score\":0.3888014125},{\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/m.startribune.com\\/how-m-ms-found-itself-in-the-culture-wars\\/600245994\\/?clmob=y&c=n&clmob=y&c=n\",\"analyzed_text\":\"See more of the story \\n M&M's, the ubiquitous candy brand owned by Mars Wrigley, announced Monday that it would take \\\"an indefinite pause\\\" from its \\\"spokescandies,\\\" deciding that the cartoon characters with arms, legs and minimal facial features were simply too divisive for a polarized America to take. \\n The characters, which have featured in the company's ads for decades, were not weighing in on abortion or the storage of classified documents. But figures on the political right, including Tucker Carlson of Fox News, have criticized the candy as \\\"Woke M&M's,\\\" owing to a series of cosmetic tweaks in recent years. \\n Here's how we got here, to the extent that it's possible to explain. \\n How Mars Wrigley explained its decision. \\n In a statement Monday, Mars Wrigley began with words familiar to anyone about to have a breakup conversation: \\\"America, let's talk.\\\" \\n \\\"In the last year, we've made some changes to our beloved spokescandies,\\\" the company said. \\\"We weren't sure if anyone would even notice.\\\" \\n Most people hadn't. \\n \\\"We definitely didn't think it would break the internet,\\\" the company said. Few people thought that it had. \\n \\\"But now we get it \\u2014 even a candy's shoes can be polarizing,\\\" the company continued, surely confusing many people who had no idea what this sentence could possibly mean. We'll come back to that. \\n Being polarizing is \\\"the last thing M&M's wanted since we're all about bringing people together,\\\" the company said. \\\"Therefore, we have decided to take an indefinite pause from the spokescandies.\\\" \\n It offered up an apparent solution: \\\"In their place, we are proud to introduce a spokesperson America can agree on: the beloved Maya Rudolph,\\\" the actress and \\\"Saturday Night Live\\\" alum who has not, as of this date, been central to any culture wars. \\\"We are confident Ms. Rudolph will champion the power of fun to create a world where everyone feels they belong,\\\" the company said. \\n Gabrielle Wesley, chief marketing officer for Mars Wrigley North America, said in a statement that the decision to engage Rudolph as the \\\"chief of fun and spokesperson\\\" for M&Ms had been \\\"in the works for a while.\\\" Rudolph will appear in an ad campaign that will debut during the Super Bowl LVII broadcast on Feb. 12, the company said. \\n \\\"The original colorful cast of M&Ms spokescandies are, at present, pursuing personal passions,\\\" Wesley said. \\n Yes, a candy's shoes can be polarizing. \\n It turns out there is an appropriate level of sexiness that M&M's figures should display in their footwear, and America is divided on how sexy that should be. \\n In January 2022, M&M's gave the aching feet of its two female spokescandies a break, replacing the green M&M's heels with flats and swapping the brown M&M's stilettos for smaller, more comfortable heels. \\n This decision, to some, was an injustice. \\n \\\"M&M's will not be satisfied until every last cartoon character is deeply unappealing and totally androgynous,\\\" Carlson railed on his show. \\\"Until the moment when you wouldn't want to have a drink with any one of them. That's the goal. When you're totally turned off, we've achieved equity. They've won.\\\" \\n The candy's new look was not exactly at the top of Carlson's concerns \\u2014 the clip received some mockery from his political opponents, and most people moved on. But this month, Carlson declared that the \\\"woke M&M's have returned\\\" after Mars Wrigley introduced a new, purple M&M to the roster, and the others got a new look. \\n \\\"The green M&M's got her boots back but apparently is now a lesbian, maybe, and there is also a plus-sized, obese purple M&M,\\\" he said. \\\"So we're going to cover that, of course. Because that's what we do.\\\" \\n The M&M's Twitter account has shown little desire to engage in the spats, in recent months tweeting almost exclusively to wish people happy holidays. In early January, when the purple M&M was revealed, the brand said it was \\\"celebrating women across the country who are flipping the status quo.\\\"\",\"similarity_score\":0.0910837564},{\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.themarysue.com\\/the-green-mm-controversy-explained\\/?fbclid=IwAR1J3YKOPrgCQ1HaSUZwdFicFj3w4Hs8TdPnyrHILNkJKxvtJIyhWNNb73o\",\"analyzed_text\":\"Shit like this makes me want to leave the internet forever. \\n Conservatives are mad again.

Buckle up gang, this will be a bumpy ride. \\n Who are the \\u201cSpokescandies\\u201d? \\n You\\u2019ve seen them before. On bags of M&Ms and on your TV screen during Super Bowl commercial breaks. They\\u2019re those near-human sized anthropomorphic M&Ms with hands and feet and eyes and mouths that are always trying to not get eaten by a hungry American populace. The two most famous spokescandies are Red and Yellow, a red regular M&M and a yellow peanut M&M, respectively. \\n But they aren\\u2019t the only M&Ms in the gang. \\n Since the creation of Red and Yellow, the good people in Mars\\u2019 candy advertising department have come up with a\\u2014for lack of a better term\\u2014handful of other M&Ms to represent their corporate interests. There\\u2019s the neurotic Orange, the suave Blue, the kinky librarian Brown, and the absolute sex icon Green. \\n Except Green isn\\u2019t a sex icon anymore. \\n The company recently unveiled a new design for the M&M squad in an effort to make the brand \\u201cmore inclusive, welcoming, and unifying.\\u201d What does that mean? Green now wears flats and Brown is wearing a slightly more sensible heel. \\n Oh, Jesus, I see the problem now. \\u201cInclusive\\u201d is the trigger word. \\n Conservatives were quick to condemn the change (more on this in a minute), no doubt unhappy with the squad\\u2019s new identity as \\u201cwokescandies.\\u201d Bafflingly enough, the rest of the internet seems to have jumped aboard the outrage train as well. Rolling Stone recently published an article titled \\u201cLet the Green M&M Be a Nasty Little Slut\\u201d because THAT\\u2019S the kind of article our corrupt and war-ravaged planet needs in order to further the ultimate goal of universal human tolerance and understanding. Other public figures claim that Green has been \\u201creverse yassified,\\u201d and I\\u2019m like, GIRL SHE\\u2019S BEEN WALKING IN THOSE HEELS FOR 20 YEARS, LET THAT QUEEN REST. \\n So M&Ms are getting a ton of heat. They\\u2019re basically being death-gripped by the hot, sweaty palm of the internet. And we all know what happens to M&Ms when you keep them in your hand for too long, right? They melt. And that\\u2019s exactly what Mars did as well. \\n In response to the controversy, M&Ms announced that they would be pulling their spokescandies \\u201cindefinitely,\\u201d (or at least until the this Category 5 shitstorm blows over) and replacing them with Maya Rudolph. \\n What does Maya Rudolph have to do with this? \\n You know, Maya Rudolph? From SNL? She does an impression of Kamala Harris? That Maya Rudolph! And I honestly don\\u2019t even know how to feel. The fact that there is a war raging in Ukraine but that America is so worried about the footwear of decades-old fictional candy mascots that we had to REPLACE them with a TV star just for the \\u201ccontroversy\\u201d to die down\\u2014it boggles my mind. The fact that I even have to write the word \\u201ccontroversy\\u201d in the same sentence as \\u201cM&Ms\\u201d makes me want to peace out. I\\u2019m done. I quit, America. You win. Just let me crawl into a hole where I never have to see the cold, gray light of an iPhone screen ever again. \\n But I can\\u2019t crawl away into a dark hole, can I? Nope! Because this is America after all, and someone would likely try to charge me RENT for living in a subterranean cave. I\\u2019d probably have to pay a goddamn property tax on my dingy little hovel, too. So that means baby\\u2019s gotta make money somehow. And how is baby gonna do that? By writing about the fake shoes of a bunch of fake candy mascots. \\n It\\u2019s worth noting that Mars plans on debuting a new M&Ms ad during the Super Bowl. As Slate points out, the teaser image for that 30-second ad features the \\u201cspokecandies\\u201d in (sexy, sexy) silhouette, making it pretty likely that this whole Maya Rudolph switcheroo is part of a marketing ploy. \\n What\\u2019s up with the shoes? \\n So what\\u2019s wrong with the shoes? \\n Nothing. Truly nothing. WE DIDN\\u2019T EVEN DO AWAY WITH THE HEELS. BROWN M&M IS LITERALLY STILL WEARING HEELS. IF YOU CAN\\u2019T GET OFF AT NIGHT WITHOUT KNOWING THAT SOMEWHERE OUT THERE, THERE IS A SEXY M&M WEARING HIGH HEELS, THEN JUST THINK OF BROWN M&M. WHY DOES THE SEXY M&M NEED TO BE GREEN FOR YOU TO GET YOUR ROCKS OFF? \\n Honestly, the only M&M whose shoes need work are Blue M&M\\u2019s. I don\\u2019t even know how he can walk in those things. They must weigh 16 pounds each. \\n But this \\u201ccontroversy\\u201d goes deeper than just M&Ms footwear.

The candy that has always (throughout most my life) been the small candy\\u2019s representatives.

Let Fox News think they\\u2019ve won and get rid of the M&M\\u2019s for a few weeks, only to bring them back just to make them mad. Bonus points if the green M&M and brown M&M make out. Go even further! Cast them with famous voices and have them all fall in love with each other.

The internet was furious, but seemingly no one took it harder than Carlson, who railed against the \\u201cless sexy\\u201d green M&M as just the start of a slippery, candy-coated slope. \\n To be clear, Carlson was not the first or only fully grown adult to speak out about the changes made to M&M\\u2019s animated candy representatives last year. Twitter was also mad, and Rolling Stone was downright livid. The \\u201cspokescandies,\\u201d first introduced in 1995 in response to disappointing sales, have apparently become an integral part of American culture.

Until the moment you wouldn\\u2019t want to have a drink with any one of them.

Because that\\u2019s what we do.\\u201d \\n The purple M&M, introduced last fall, is a peanut M&M, hence her oval-shaped body. If we want to get particular about this, her body is actually slimmer than the other female \\u201cspokescandies,\\u201d green and brown, who are both perfectly round. \\n There\\u2019s reason to wonder (and at least one person on the internet has) whether whoever hates the new M&M\\u2019s \\u201cspokescandies\\u201d because Tucker told them to will react any better to Maya Rudolph\\u2014a Saturday Night Live alum who, lately, has become best known for playing Vice President Kamala Harris.

Can we go back to the part where Tucker Carlson, supposed hater of cancel culture, just canceled a bunch of animated candies? \\n Is Tucker proud of himself now that the green M&M, robbed of her sex appeal, is now also unemployed? Is he prepared to answer to her (non-canonical) husband, and to their children (whom I imagine as M&M Minis)?

(AP Photo\\/Matt Rourke, File) \\n NEW YORK (AP) \\u2014 Mars says it's pausing using its trademark M&M's spokescandies and has enlisted actor and comedian Maya Rudolph to star in its marketing efforts, including its Super Bowl ad campaign. \\n The news comes three weeks before M&Ms is set to return to the Super Bowl with an ad after sitting it out last year. Mars hasn't disclosed any other creative details about the ad. \\n The Super Bowl is advertising\\u2019s biggest stage, with big-name brands pulling out all the stops and paying millions for a 30-second ad in an effort to capture the attention of the more than 100 million viewers that watch the game live. Many spend millions more on marketing campaigns leading up to the big event. \\n Mars revamped the M&M candies last year. which are featured in red, green, orange, yellow, brown and blue, to give them more nuanced personalities. The green M&M ditched high-heeled boots in favor of sneakers and the brown candy opted for lower heels instead of stilettos. Some fans weren't happy about the changes and took to social media to complain. \\n In a posting widely shared on social media on Monday, Mars said it was taking an \\u201cindefinite\\u201d pause on using the spokescandies. \\n \\u201cNow we get it \\u2014 even a candy's shoes can be polarizing,\\u201d the statement said. \\u201cWhich was the last thing M&M's wanted since we're all about bringing people together.\\u201d \\n Mars didn't say how long the pause would be for. Some likened the news to a publicity stunt that Planters tried in 2020 when it announced it was \\u201ckilling off\\u201d its beloved spokescharacter Mr. Peanut ahead of the game. \\n \\u201cM&Ms announcing that they\\u2019re getting rid of long-standing and (mostly) beloved mascots because of peer pressure is newsworthy,\\u201d said Steve Merino, chief dreative director at ad agency Aloysius Butler & Clark. \\\"That being said, many brands use their Super Bowl moment as a chance to pull a publicity stunt. Remember when Planters faked getting rid of Mr. Peanut? We\\u2019ll see if this is real, or just a thin candy shell.\\u201d \\n In Planters case, the ruse did not go seamlessly. Planters teased its Super Bowl ad nearly two weeks before the game, releasing a teaser that showed its Mr. Peanut mascot seemingly being killed. But when Kobe Bryant was killed in a helicopter crash, the marketing stunt suddenly seemed insensitive, so Planters paused its pre-game advertising. The actual Super Bowl ad was relatively inoffensive, with a baby Mr. Peanut appearing at the funeral. Planters is also returning to the Super Bowl this year for the first time since 2020, with an ad featuring Mr. Peanut. \\n The Super Bowl LVII will take place Feb. 12 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, and will be broadcast on Fox.\",\"similarity_score\":0.3514330507},{\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/nypost.com\\/2023\\/01\\/23\\/maya-rudolph-replaces-mms-spokescandies-indefinitely-amid-woke-furor\\/amp\\/\",\"analyzed_text\":\"January 23, 2023 | 1:45pm \\n Maya Rudolph is taking a bite out of the M&M\\u2019s candy controversy. \\n The \\u201cSNL\\u201d alum said Monday that she is \\u201cthrilled\\u201d to be taking over as spokesperson for M&M\\u2019s as the company puts their \\u201cspokescandies\\u201d back in the refrigerator, reported TODAY.com. \\n \\u201cI\\u2019m thrilled to be working with M&M\\u2019s,\\u201d Rudolph, 50, said. \\u201cI am a lifelong lover of the candy and I feel like it\\u2019s such an honor to be asked to be part of such a legendary brand\\u2019s campaign.\\u201d \\n The \\u201cBridesmaids\\u201d star will appear in the candy\\u2019s Super Bowl commercial during the big game on Feb. 12, but remained tight-lipped over details in her statement, saying only there will be \\u201clots of fun\\u201d moments in the ad. \\n \\u201cIt\\u2019s a very fun pairing, if I do say so myself,\\u201d said the \\u201cBig Mouth\\u201d actress. \\u201cI think little Maya would be thrilled to get to work with M&M\\u2019s.\\u201d \\n In response, M&M\\u2019s released a statement regarding the appointment. \\n \\u201cIn the last year, we\\u2019ve made some changes to our beloved spokescandies.

Give Green her boots back.\\\" And after the introduction of Purple and the Women's Day package, Fox News once again took aim at the brand. \\n \\\"What M&M'S has tried to do over the past few years is to be very inclusive, and to ensure that these characters represent in a positive way,\\\" said Calkins, the Northwestern professor. \\\"They've been quite deliberate in their efforts to do that.\\\" \\n What they didn't want was to end up a target for right-wing commentators. \\\"I think they desperately didn't set out to become a target for Fox News,\\\" Calkins said. \\\"There's only two ways you really can play it here. Either you have to back away from the characters, or you have to stand up and really get into a fight.\\\" \\n This week's announcement suggests M&M's decided to go with the first option. But it's doing so with a wink at the controversy, a strategy that may ultimately play out in its favor. \\n If, of course, the brand can pull it off. \\n 'Even a candy's shoes can be polarizing' \\n When M&M's announced its partnership with Maya Rudolph, it alluded to the reaction to Green's shoes. \\n \\\"In the last year, we've made some changes to our beloved spokescandies,\\\" M&M's said. \\\"We weren't sure if anyone would even notice. And we definitely didn't think it would break the internet. But now we get it \\u2014 even a candy's shoes can be polarizing.\\\" \\n To say that the reaction to Green's shoes broke the internet may be overstating things, to M&M's benefit. But the statement itself sparked more reaction online, with other brands like A&W piggybacking to get some attention themselves. \\n And it's hard to measure any sales impact of the character changes or the reaction to them. The brand has seen a \\\"record-breaking amount of interest in and conversions about our spokescandies,\\\" according to a spokesperson. But owner Mars, which is private, does not share sales figures. \\n Rudolph will star in an upcoming ad during the game, but the company announced the commercial back in December before the latest round of criticism, adding that the partnership was not just a knee-jerk move. \\n The deal with Rudolph has been \\\"in the works for a while,\\\" said Gabrielle Wesley, chief marketing officer for Mars Wrigley North America, in a statement this week. \\\"Let me say conclusively that this decision isn't a reaction to but rather is in support of our M&M's brand,\\\" Wesley said. \\n As for the spokescandies \\u2014 they may be benched for now, but they're not going anywhere. \\n \\\"The original colorful cast of M&M's spokescandies are, at present, pursuing other personal passions,\\\" Wesley said. Fans will learn more about their situation in the coming weeks, according to the brand. Taking them out of the spotlight wouldn't be unusual for M&M's: The characters have been around since the 1950s, and over the years M&M's has leaned on them more or less heavily in promotions. \\n But there's a risk to pulling back, noted Geraldo Matos, associate professor of marketing at Roger Williams University.

Continue to check back with us as we will be adding more information as it becomes available. \\n After breaking the internet with a few of their designs, M&M's is officially retiring their iconic candy mascots and replacing them with Maya Rudolph. Going as far back as the mid-1950s, the M&M characters are some of the most iconic figures in marketing history primarily with the Red and Yellow characters, the former of whom was originally voiced by Saturday Night Live alum Jon Lovitz and the latter first voiced by Emmy and Golden Globe winner John Goodman and later by Oscar winner J.K. Simmons. The roster of characters has grown in the years since, though this now looks to be changing in a major way. \\n The official M&M's Twitter account has announced it will be retiring the fan-favorite, multicolored candy mascots. \\n The post, which ironically features the full group of characters at the bottom of the letter, reveals that the company was taken aback by the fervent response to some recent design changes for some of the characters, and as such will be putting an \\\"indefinite pause\\\" on their future appearances. In their place, Emmy-winning Saturday Night Live alum Maya Rudolph will be acting as the company's new spokesperson. \\n Related: 15 Movie Trailers We Expect At Super Bowl 2023 \\n Despite their seemingly innocuous nature, the M&M's characters have encountered a variety of controversies throughout the years, especially over the past year. The Mars Inc. candy company had announced early last year that they would be looking to make their characters more inclusive, introducing Purple M&M, voiced by A Black Lady Sketch Show vet Amber Ruffin, the first-ever female Peanut M&M, as well as changing the designs of the Green and Brown M&Ms to give them more casual clothing, swapping out their heels for sneakers. Additionally, the chocolate-based candy came under fire with an all-female pack of Purple, Brown and Green M&Ms this month in the hopes of celebrating \\\"women everywhere who are flipping the status quo\\\", with portions of the profits even going towards nonprofit organizations supporting women in the music industry. \\n While some have praised the inclusive efforts from Mars Inc., the more toxic side of the internet have criticized the various M&Ms changes as being a \\\"woke\\\" decision. Many publications on the far right side of politics, including infamous Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who memorably admitted on the air that he no longer found the Brown M&M \\\"sexy\\\" following the redesign of the character voiced by Desperate Housewives alum Vanessa Williams. Though the characters are no longer set to be the primary marketing for the company, it will be interesting to see whether the decision to retire the M&M spokescandies will be met with a similar criticism from these conservative publications, or if it will see a more positive response. \\n Given the announcement indicates that the characters will be on an \\\"indefinite pause,\\\" the question now becomes whether Rudolph will be the permanent M&M's spokesperson, or if the spokescandies will return in the future. The news comes on the heels of Mars Inc. announcing a return to the Super Bowl for a new M&M campaign, creating the possibility that Rudolph will only briefly be the face of the brand for the NFL championship game this February, much like Danny DeVito's brief turn as the Red M&M during a Super Bowl LII ad. Only time will tell when Super Bowl LVII kicks off on Sunday, February 12, with the M&M's ad scheduled for the third commercial break of the game's second quarter. \\n More: How Betty White's Hilarious Snickers Commercial Reignited Her CareerSource: M&M's\\/Twitter \\n Grant Hermanns is a News Editor, Interviewer and Hiring Manager for Screen Rant, having joined the team in early 2021.

Gone were Green\\u2019s iconic go-go boots, replaced by sneakers. Online,\\u00a0mayhem ensued. \\n Now,\\u00a0M&M\\u2019S\\u00a0is making another, bigger change \\u2014 this time, it\\u2019s adding a brand new character to the mix. Meet Purple: She\\u2019s peanut, she sings, and she doesn\\u2019t wear high heels (she sports lace-up boots). \\n The purple peanut M&M is the first new character in 10 years, according to the brand. \\n \\u201cPurple has been in the works for a very long time, for years,\\u201d said Jane Hwang, Global Vice President of M&M\\u2019S. \\u201cThis was about ensuring that the entire crew, the entire cast of spokescandies, were reflecting the world that we\\u2019re living in.\\u201d \\n Purple has a specific personality \\u2014 quirky, confident and just a little awkward. Her debut comes with a song, \\u201cI\\u2019m Just Gonna Be Me,\\u201d which can be seen in a video online and streamed on platforms including Spotify and Apple Music. \\n This doesn\\u2019t mean that a purple M&M is coming to bags of Peanut M&M\\u2019S, however. \\n The new character will appear in stores, on the M&M\\u2019S website and on some limited edition packaging, said Hwang. And customers will be able to buy purple M&M\\u2019S online, an option that was already available. But when it comes to a regular bag of peanut M&M\\u2019S, purple fans are out of luck. \\n That could be a new source of outrage. \\n In the mid-90s,\\u00a0people voted for blue to replace tan\\u00a0in bags of the candy. In 2002, M&M\\u2019S\\u00a0once again asked people to vote, this time for a color that would be added for just a limited time. Purple won, but didn\\u2019t stick around for long. \\n Online, people frequently ask\\u00a0why there are no purple M&M\\u2019S. Some bemoan the missed opportunity in the 1990s to make purple a permanent addition to the lineup.\\u00a0Some even think the vote was rigged. \\n Still, the new character, while not an actual new candy, is an acknowledgment from M&M\\u2019S that people are pining for purple. \\n \\u201cWe\\u2019ve heard for a long time that purple is certainly a consumer favorite,\\u201d said Hwang. \\n But the brand is really focusing on the characters, rather than the actual edible candies, she noted. \\n \\u2018Give green her boots back\\u2019 \\n When M&M\\u2019S made changes to its characters\\u2019 footwear early this year, the idea was to make them more current and relevant, with characters that, Mars hopes, will make people feel like they belong. The new footwear was supposed to help telegraph that message. Orange finally got a pair of shoes with tied laces, Brown got lower heels, and others also got subtle updates to their style. \\n But there was an outsized reaction to Green\\u2019s new kicks. \\n An opinion piece in the Washington Post declared \\u201cThe M&M\\u2019S changes aren\\u2019t progressive. Give Green her boots back.\\u201d In a\\u00a0provocatively-headlined article,\\u00a0Rolling Stone described the change as \\u201cnothing more than tectonic.\\u201d Thousands have signed a petition to \\u201ckeep the green M&M sexy.\\u201d \\n People are known to have strong feelings about things online, particularly changes to beloved characters. When\\u00a0Lola Bunny got a new look for the new Space Jam movie, for example, fans were outraged. \\n But for M&M\\u2019S, reaction to the character makeover was \\u201cunprecedented,\\u201d said Hwang. \\u201cWe were incredibly overwhelmed,\\u201d she noted. \\u201cNow we know for certain that M&M\\u2019S is a cultural icon.\\u201d \\n So when it came to the new purple character, Hwang said, M&M\\u2019S didn\\u2019t take the reaction to Green into account. Purple \\u201chad nothing to do \\u2026 with the commentaries we saw about Green,\\u201d she said. \\n And for now, at least, M&M\\u2019S has no plans to restore Green\\u2019s look. \\n \\u201cThe characters \\u2026 are continuously evolving to reflect the times that we\\u2019re living in,\\u201d Hwang said, adding that the brand hopes consumers will \\u201cget to know our characters for much more than their footwear.\\u201d \\n So will the go-go boots ever make a comeback?

Some have criticised the brand for being weak and bowing to pressure while others who were apparently boycotting the brand say they'll continue their boycotts anyway... just because. \\n \\\"Congratulations on finding the weakest possible response to the dumbest manufactured outrage campaign. Maya Rudolph is lovely, but let\\u2019s be honest: What you\\u2019re announcing here is that your real spokesperson is Tucker Carlson,\\\" one person wrote. \\\"A woman attempted to wear flats on the job and was bullied out of her career,\\\" the writer Justin Kirkland tweeted. \\\"We are here because Tucker can't control himself around the green M&M,\\\" Alejandra Caraballo added. \\n In the corner of the green M&M fanciers, Jason Rantz tweeted: \\\"You mean, your sales dipped after going woke and you don\\u2019t want to admit it outright?\\\" \\\"First you politicized a \\\"beloved\\\" character, then you eliminated a beloved character and substituted a political hack as a replacement.

Bovendien maakte het snoepmerk al in december bekend dat Rudolph in de reclame van M&M's zou spelen rond de Super Bowl, de finale van het American footballseizoen en een van de best bekeken tv-avonden van het jaar. De stap van M&M's zou daarom ook een publiciteitsstunt kunnen zijn. \\n M&M's maakt al jaren reclames met de pratende chocolaatjes 'Red' en 'Yellow'.

But anyway, we have bigger candies to crush. \\n \\u201cAmerica, let\\u2019s talk,\\u201d M&M\\u2019s wrote in its statement. \\u201cIn the last year, we\\u2019ve made some changes to our beloved spokescandies. We weren\\u2019t sure if anyone would even notice. And we definitely didn\\u2019t think it would break the internet. But now we get it\\u2014even a candy\\u2019s shoes can be polarizing.\\u201d \\n In a statement provided to NBC\\u2019s TODAY.com, Rudolph said she\\u2019s \\u201cthrilled\\u201d at the opportunity. \\u201cI am a lifelong lover of the candy,\\u201d she wrote, \\u201cand I feel like it\\u2019s such an honor to be asked to be part of such a legendary brand\\u2019s campaign.\\u201d \\n These are brave words for the person replacing a fictional M&M, whose new sneakers have apparently prompted an all-out culture war. \\n In a totally normal segment about the issue last January, Carlson told his audience, \\u201cM&M\\u2019s will not be satisfied until every last cartoon character is deeply unappealing and totally androgynous. Until the moment you wouldn\\u2019t want to have a drink with any one of them. That\\u2019s the goal.\\u201d \\n This year, he followed that up with the same ideas, albeit perhaps a little less gusto: \\u201cThe green M&M got her boots back, but apparently is now a lesbian, maybe?\\u201d Carlson told his audience during a recent segment. \\u201cAnd there\\u2019s also a plus-sized, obese purple M&M, so we're gonna cover that, of course... Because that\\u2019s what we do.\\u201d \\n The purple M&M, introduced last fall, is a peanut M&M, hence her oval-shaped body. If we want to get particular about this, her body is actually slimmer than the other female \\u201cspokescandies,\\u201d green and brown, who are both perfectly round. \\n There\\u2019s reason to wonder (and at least one person on the internet has) whether whoever hates the new M&M\\u2019s \\u201cspokescandies\\u201d because Tucker told them to will react any better to Maya Rudolph\\u2014a Saturday Night Live alum who, lately, has become best known for playing Vice President Kamala Harris. Then again, what\\u2019s one more surreal twist in perhaps our stupidest discourse since that time everyone started arguing about whether Harry Styles really spat on Chris Pine. \\n But hold on for just one more candy-chomping second. Can we go back to the part where Tucker Carlson, supposed hater of cancel culture, just canceled a bunch of animated candies? \\n Is Tucker proud of himself now that the green M&M, robbed of her sex appeal, is now also unemployed? Is he prepared to answer to her (non-canonical) husband, and to their children (whom I imagine as M&M Minis)? Does this delicious mess trace back to that (inaccurate) theory he has about women pushing men out of the labor force?
